<p align="center">A Bee Swarm Simulator Macro</p>

# Note from Dev
Beesanity is currently undergoing development for the first release. I just need to plan out on what features I can add to beesanity other than a cool looking Interface and just the macro itself... The first release of this might or might not be stacked with good features, but I will try to do my best to create something unique.
